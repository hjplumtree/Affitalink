It's a site where you can check out countless affiliate links in one place! Connects to the network site that managers the affiliate, helping you to find the offers quicker!

Here's how:
* You can filter out to see offers from your advertiser selection
* Each offer contains only you need such as title, description, promo code, tracking link and so on
* One-click copy functionality is also available!

### Why you need Affitalink

- [x] Advertisers are scattered across multiple network sites. As a result, you might join several network sites. It can increase to 2 to 3 at least and over 10 at most.

- [x] The process of logging in to the network sites and finding the offers you want on different UI can be exhausting.

To reduce this hassle and time, Affitalink was born!
